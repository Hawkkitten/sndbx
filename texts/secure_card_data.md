# Secure Card Data

Saferpay Secure Card Data is a way to store vital credit card data in a [PCI-compliant](https://saferpay.github.io/sndbx/index.html#pci) way.
The process involves saving the card data inside the Saferpay Card Alias store, which is PCI-certified.
The API will provide the merchant with a card token (called alias), which then can be used instead of the real card data.
With this alias, merchants are capable of doing transactions, without knowing the card-data itself.
