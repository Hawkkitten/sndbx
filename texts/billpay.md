# BillPay

BillPay can also be processed via the Saferpay JSON API. 
However, as BillPay is a third party provider, there are a few things which must be observed:

## <a name="bp-requirement"></a> Voraussetzungen

*	A corresponding licence and thus the existence of a valid identification with a username and password for the Saferpay system.
*	Availability of at least one active Saferpay terminal via which payment can be carried out and availability of the associated Saferpay TerminalId.
*	A valid acceptance agreement for BillPay must be present.
*	The address of the purchaser is present and is forwarded to BillPay.
>
**Attention** For BillPay activation on the Saferpay terminal, please inform **service.saferpay@six-payment-services.com** of the BillPay access details and the desired currency.

## <a name="bp-approval-api"></a> BillPay Certification via API

Before they can conclude a transaction via BillPay, all BillPay customers have to be entered into a so-called “Certification Provider”. Prior to the going-live, BillPay expects each merchant to trigger a transaction via this provider. As proof, BillPay requires a complete invoice from the merchant system. After examination, information on the live account data is provided. In contracts for **BillPay Purchase on Receipt** and **BillPay Direct Debit**, the operation must be performed for each payment method.

For certification, a simple transaction on the [Payment Page](https://saferpay.github.io/jsonapi/#Payment_v1_PaymentPage_Initialize) is performed using the JSON API. For this, the means of payment (**BillPay Purchase on Receipt** or **BillPay Direct Debit**) must always be specified explicitly via the **Payment Methods** parameter. Otherwise, the payment method will not be shown on the Payment Page. In addition, it is generally the case – even in live operations – that the transfer of address details to BillPay is not necessary. This can be mapped in two different ways:

### 1. Delivery via parameters

If address data have already been captured in the shop, they can be forwarded to Saferpay via the corresponding parameter.

### 2. Data capture via a form

Alternatively, an address form, in which the customer must enter their address details, can be displayed in the Saferpay Payment Page. Make sure that all the address details needed for BillPay payment are requested in the address form.

### Assert

With [Payment Page Assert](https://saferpay.github.io/jsonapi/#Payment_v1_PaymentPage_Assert), all the necessary information is sent back to the merchant. This includes the transfer of purchase-on-invoice credit transfer data that must be forwarded to the buyer.

### Capture

Like other means of payment, BillPay transactions must also be booked. For this booking, use the [Transaction Capture](https://saferpay.github.io/jsonapi/#Payment_v1_Transaction_Capture) method. If you have agreed upon the due dates of payments with BillPay, the due date of payment can be delayed in Capture Request with **DelayInDays**. 

>
For this, see the **Billpay** container.
>

--->>>
>
>    <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right"></i> Example for Capture Request:
>
```json
{
  "RequestHeader": {
    "SpecVersion": "1.3",
    "CustomerId": "[your customer id]",
    "RequestId": "[unique request id]",
    "RetryIndicator": 0
  },
  "TransactionReference": {
    "TransactionId": "723n4MAjMdhjSAhAKEUdA8jtl9jb"
  },
  "Billpay": {
    "DelayInDays": 5
  }
}
```

Some of the key information, such as the invoice data, are returned by Saferpay via [Capture](https://saferpay.github.io/jsonapi/#Payment_v1_Transaction_Capture).

## <a name="bp-approval-bo"></a> BillPay Certification via Saferpay Backoffice

Because it is not always possible to conduct certification in every shop without interrupting live operations, Saferpay Backoffice offers the option of creating a payment URL for a BillPay test payment via the Payment Page. This can be used to perform the acceptance test.
>
**Attetion:** Because this is not loaded via the shop, the shop is not informed about the purchase. It is therefore necessary to manually create the invoice required by BillPay. You can find the necessary data for this in the Saferpay Backoffice via **Transactions > Journal**. Here you can find a list of all transactions, which you can then view in detail.
>

In your Saferpay Backoffice go to the **Webshop** heading and select the option **All Offers**:
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferpay/sndbx/master/images/billpay_all_offers.png "Webshop > All Offers")

Then click on “Add new offer”: 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferpay/sndbx/master/images/billpay_add_new_offer.png "Add new offer")

The form for a new offer is shown:
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferpay/sndbx/master/images/billpay_offer_form.png "New offer form")

Fill out the fields for the description and the amount and, if necessary, select the currency and add the return addresses for your webshop. Then click on “Save”.

The stored offer will appear with the test payment URL for BillPay acceptance:
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saferpay/sndbx/master/images/billpay_offer_url.png "Offer URL")
>
**Attention!** Make sure that the checkbox marked “Caution: only use for test transactions!” has been ticked. 
>
>
**Attention!** When creating an acceptance invoice, ensure that the test URL created contains a random OrderId allocated by Saferpay.  
>
>
**Attention!** When using a test URL, the customer address must be entered manually in the Payment Page.
>

After loading the links, the Saferpay Payment Page appears with one or more options for BillPay test payment methods:
